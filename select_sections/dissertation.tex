\cvsection{Dissertation Summary}

For my dissertation, I developed software tools to predict changes in the gait of wearers of lower limb robotic prostheses.
I formulated new objectives and dynamic models for prosthetic gait prediction trajectory optimization.
I also demonstrated methods for using these tools to conduct parametric design studies, and showed that doing so provides novel design insight.
